# Mobile Jumping Game

This project was developed for an HCI course in my Master's program in Virtual and Augmented Reality (VAR).

It is a simple mobile Unity game where the player taps the screen to make a character jump over incoming obstacles.  
The game includes a score counter, a game over screen, and a small menu.

The goal of the project was to design a mobile application.
